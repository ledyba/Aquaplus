  * New debian packaging attempt. (Closes: #232658)
  * debian/control: nasm dependency for i386 changed from nasm [i386]
    to nasm | not+i386 on advice from Robert Millan.
  * debian/README.Debian: the text was a bit confusing, changed it so
    it doesn't suggest the package is compiled for a specific subarch.
  * debian/rules: fixed the dh_link package targets (were using
    $version instead of $major)
