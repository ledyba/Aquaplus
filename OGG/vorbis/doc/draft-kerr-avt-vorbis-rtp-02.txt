1 Introduction

   The Xiph.org Foundation creates and defines codecs for use in 
   multimedia that are not encumbered by patents and thus may be freely 
   implemented by any individual or organization.

   Vorbis is a general purpose perceptual audio codec intended to allow 
   maximum encoder flexibility, thus allowing it to scale competitively 
   over an exceptionally wide range of bitrates.   At the high 
   quality/bitrate end of the scale (CD or DAT rate stereo, 
   16/24 bits), it is in the same league as MPEG-2 and MPC. Similarly, 
   the 1.0 encoder can encode high-quality CD and DAT rate stereo at 
   below 48k bits/sec without resampling to a lower rate.   Vorbis is 
   also intended for lower and higher sample rates (from 8kHz 
   telephony to 192kHz digital masters) and a range of channel 
   representations (monaural, polyphonic, stereo, quadraphonic, 5.1, 
   ambisonic, or up to 255 discrete channels).

   Vorbis encoded audio is generally encapsulated within an Ogg format 
   bitstream [1], which provides framing and synchronization.  For the 
   purposes of RTP transport, this layer is unnecessary, and so raw 
   Vorbis packets are used in the payload.

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

2 Payload Format

   For RTP based transportation of Vorbis encoded audio the standard 
   RTP header is followed by an 8 bit payload header, then the payload 
   data.


2.1 RTP Header

     0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           synchronization source (SSRC) identifier            |
   +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+
   |            contributing source (CSRC) identifiers             |
   |                              ...                              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The RTP header begins with an octet of fields (V, P, X, and CC) to   
   support specialized RTP uses (see [4] and [5] for details). For 
   Vorbis RTP, the following values are used.

   Version (V): 2 bits
      This field identifies the version of RTP. The version
      used by this specification is two (2).

   Padding (P): 1 bit
      If the padding bit is set, the packet contains one or more
      additional padding octets at the end which are not part of
      the payload.  P is set if the total packet size is less than 
      the MTU.  

   Extension (X): 1 bit
      If the extension, X,  bit is set, the fixed header MUST be 
      followed by exactly one header extension, with a format defined 
      in Section 5.3.1. of [4], 

   CSRC count (CC): 4 bits
      The CSRC count contains the number of CSRC identifiers.

Internet Draft      draft-kerr-avt-vorbis-rtp-02.txt       June 10, 2003


   Marker (M): 1 bit
      Set to zero.  Audio silence suppression not used.  This conforms
      to section 4.1 of [6].

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits
      An RTP profile for a class of applications is expected to assign 
      a payload type for this format, or a dynamically allocated 
      payload type SHOULD be chosen which designates the payload as 
      Vorbis.

   Sequence number: 16 bits
      The sequence number increments by one for each RTP data packet
      sent, and may be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and
      to restore packet sequence. This field is detailed further in
      [3].

   Timestamp: 32 bits
      A timestamp representing the sampling time of the first sample of
      the first Vorbis packet in the RTP packet.  The clock frequency 
      MUST be set to the sample rate of the encoded audio data and is 
      conveyed out-of-band.

   SSRC/CSRC identifiers: 
      These two fields, 32 bits each with one SSRC field and a maximum 
      of 16 CSRC fields, are as defined in [3].  


2.2 Payload Header

   After the RTP Header section the next octet is the Payload Header.  
   This octet is split into a number of bitfields detailing the format
   of the following Payload Data packets.

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | C | F | R |  # of packets     |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Continuation (C): 1 bit
      Set to one if this is a continuation of a fragmented packet.

   Fragmented (F): 1 bit
      Set to one if the payload contains complete packets or if it
      contains the last fragment of a fragmented packet. 

   Reserved (R): 1 bit
      Reserved, MUST be set to zero by senders, and ignored by 
      receivers.

   The last 5 bits are the number of complete packets in this payload.  
   This provides for a maximum number of 32 Vorbis packets in the 
   payload.  If C is set to one, this number SHOULD be 0.

2.3 Payload Data

   Vorbis packets are unbounded in length currently.  At some future
   point there will likely be a practical limit placed on packet
   length.  

   Typical Vorbis packet sizes are from very small (2-3 bytes) to 
   quite large (8-12 kilobytes).  The reference implementation [9] 
   typically produces packets less than ~800 bytes, except for the
   header packets which are ~4-12 kilobytes.

   Within a RTP context the maximum Vorbis packet SHOULD be kept below
   the MTU size, typically 1500 octets, including the RTP and payload 
   headers, to avoid fragmentation.  For the delivery of Vorbis audio 
   using RTP the maximum size of the header block is limited to 64K.

   If the payload contains a single Vorbis packet or a Vorbis packet
   fragment, the Vorbis packet data follows the payload header.

   For payloads which consist of multiple Vorbis packets, payload data 
   consists of one octet representing the packet length followed by 
   the packet data for each of the Vorbis packets in the payload.

   The Vorbis packet length octet is the length of the data block 
   minus one.   

   The payload packing of the Vorbis data packets SHOULD follow the
   guidelines set-out in section 4.4 of [5] where the oldest packet
   occurs immediately after the RTP packet header.

   Channel mapping of the audio is in accordance with BS. 775-1 
   ITU-R.


2.4 Example RTP Packet

   Here is an example RTP packet containing two Vorbis packets.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


3 Frame Packetizing

   Each RTP packet contains either one complete Vorbis packet, one 
   Vorbis packet fragment, or an integer number of complete Vorbis 
   packets (up to a max of 32 packets, since the number of packets 
   is defined by a 5 bit value).

   Any Vorbis packet that is larger than 256 octets and less than the
   path-MTU MUST be placed in a RTP packet by itself.

   Any Vorbis packet that is 256 bytes or less SHOULD be bundled in the
   RTP packet with as many Vorbis packets as will fit, up to a maximum
   of 32.

   If a Vorbis packet will not fit within the network MTU, it SHOULD be
   fragmented.  A fragmented packet has a zero in the last five bits 
   of the payload header.  Each fragment after the first will also set 
   the Continued (C) bit to one in the payload header.  The RTP packet 
   containing the last fragment of the Vorbis packet will have the 
   Final Fragment (F) bit set to one.  To maintain the correct sequence
   for fragmented packet reception the timestamp field of fragmented 
   packets MUST be the same as the first packet sent, with the sequence 
   number incremented as normal for the subsequent RTP packets. 




3.1 Example Fragmented Vorbis Packet

   Here is an example fragmented Vorbis packet split over three RTP
   packets.

   The C bit is set to 1 and the number of packets field is set to 0.
   For large Vorbis fragments there can be several of these type of
   payload packets.  The maximum packet size SHOULD be no greater
   than the MTU of 1500 octets, including all RTP and payload headers.
   The sequence number has been incremented by one but the timestamp 
   field remains the same as the initial packet.

   This is the last Vorbis fragment packet.  The C and F bits are 
   set and the packet count remains set to 0.  As in the previous 
   packets the timestamp remains set to the first packet in the 
   sequence and the sequence number has been incremented.


3.2 Packet Loss

   As there is no error correction within the Vorbis stream, packet 
   loss will result in a loss of signal.  Packet loss is more of an 
   issue for fragmented Vorbis packets as the client will have to 
   cope with the handling of the C and F flags.  If we use the 
   fragmented Vorbis packet example above and the first packet is
   lost the client SHOULD detect that the next packet has the packet
   count field set to 0 and the C bit is set and MUST drop it.  The
   next packet, which is the final fragmented packet, MUST be dropped
   in the same manner.  Feedback reports on lost and dropped packets
   MUST be sent back via RTCP.


4 Configuration Headers

   To decode a Vorbis stream three configuration header blocks are
   needed.  The first header indicates the sample and bitrates, the 
   number of channels and the version of the Vorbis encoder used.  
   The second header contains the decoders probability model, or 
   codebooks and the third header details stream metadata.

   As the RTP stream may change certain configuration data mid-session
   there are two different methods for delivering this configuration
   data to a client, RTCP which is detailed below and SDP which is 
   detailed in section 5.  SDP delivery is used to set-up an initial
   state for the client application and RTCP is used to change state
   during the session.  The changes may be due to different metadata
   or codebooks as well as different bitrates of the stream.

   Unlike other mainstream audio codecs Vorbis has no statically 
   configured probability model, instead it packs all entropy decoding
   configuration, VQ and Huffman models into a self-contained codebook.
   This codebook block also requires additional identification 
   information detailing the number of audio channels, bit rates and
   other information used to initialise the Vorbis stream.


4.1 RTCP Based Header Transmission

   The three header data blocks are sent out-of-band as an APP defined 
   RTCP message with the 4 octet name field set to VORB. 

   VORB RTCP packets MUST set the padding (P) flag and add the
   appropriate padding octets needed to conform with section 6.6 
   of [3].  Synchronizing the configuration headers to the RTP stream 
   is  critical.  A 32 bit timestamp field is used to indicate the
   timepoint when a VORB header MUST be applied to the RTP stream. 
   VORB RTCP packets MUST be sent just ahead of the change in the RTP
   stream.  As the reception loss of the RTCP header will mean the 
   RTP stream will fail to decode properly the freqency of their 
   periodic retransmission MUST be high enough to minimize the    
   stream disturbance whilst remaining under the RTCP bandwidth
   allocation.

   The first Vorbis config header defines the Vorbis stream 
   attributes.  The Vorbis version MUST be set to zero to comply with
   this document.  The fields Sample Rate, Bitrate Maximum/Nominal/
   Minimum and Num Audio Channels are set in accordance with [6] with 
   the bsz fields above referring to the blocksize parameters.  The 
   framing bit is not used for RTP transportation and so applications 
   constructing Vorbis files MUST take care to set this if required.

   The next 8 bits are used to indicate the presence of the two 
   other Vorbis stream config headers and the size overflow header.

   The c flag indicates the presence of a codebook header block, the
   m flag indicates the presence of a comment metadata block.  The o
   flag indicates if the size of either of the c and m headers would
   make the VORB packet greater than that allowed for a RTCP message.

   The remaining five bits, indicated with an x, are reserved/unused
   and MUST be set to 0 for this version of the document.

   If the c flag is set then the next header block will contain the 
   codebook configuration data.  

   This setup information MUST be completely intact, as a client can 
   not decode a stream with an incomplete or corrupted codebook set.

   A 16 bit codebook length field and a 16 bit 1's complement checksum
   of the codebook precedes the codebook datablock.  The length field 
   allows for codebooks to be up to 64K in size. The checksum is used 
   to detect a corrupted codebook.

Internet Draft      draft-kerr-avt-vorbis-rtp-02.txt       June 10, 2003


   If a checksum failure is detected then a new config header file
   SHOULD be obtained from SDP, if the codebook has not changed since
   the session has started.  If no SDP value is set and no other method
   for obtaining the config headers exists then this is considered to 
   be a failure and SHOULD be reported to the client application.

   If the m flag is set then the next header block will contain the 
   comment metadata, such as artist name, track title and so on.  These
   metadata messages are not intended to be fully descriptive but to 
   offer basic track/song information.  This message MUST be sent at 
   the start of the stream, together with the setup and codebook 
   headers, even if it contains no information.  During a session the
   metadata associated with the stream may change from that specified 
   at the start, e.g. a live concert broadcast changing acts/scenes, so
   clients MUST have the ability to receive m header blocks.  Details
   on the format of the comments can be found in the Vorbis 
   documentation [7].

   The format for the data takes the form of a 32 bit codec vendors
   name length field followed by the name encoded in UTF-8.  The next
   field denotes the number of user comments and then the user comments
   length and text field pairs, up to the number indicated by the user 
   comment list length.   

   If the o, overflow, bit is set then the URI of a whole header block
   is specified in an overflow URI field, which is a null terminated 
   UTF-8 string.  The header file specified at the URI MUST NOT have 
   the overflow flag set, otherwise a loop condition will occur. 


4.2 Codebook Caching

   Codebook caching allows clients that have previously connected to a 
   stream to re-use the codebooks and thus begin the playback of the 
   session faster.  When a client receives a codebook it may store
   it, together with the MD5 key, locally and can compare the MD5 key
   of locally cached codebooks with the key it receives via SDP, which
   is detailed in section 5.1.   
   

5 Session Description for Vorbis RTP Streams

   Session description information concerning the Vorbis stream 
   SHOULD be provided if possible and MUST be in accordance with [8].  
   The SDP information is split into two sections, a mandatory 
   section detailing the RTP stream and an optional section used to 
   convey information needed for codebook caching.

Internet Draft      draft-kerr-avt-vorbis-rtp-02.txt       June 10, 2003


   Below is an outline of the mandatory SDP attributes.

   u=<URI of Vorbis header file>
   m=audio <port> RTP/AVP 98
   c=IN IP4/6 <URI of Vorbis stream>
   a=rtpmap:98 vorbis/<sample rate>

   The contents of the Vorbis Header file referred to in the 
   u attribute MUST contain all three of the config header blocks 
   as specified in section 4.  The overflow bit of the header packet
   MUST not be set.

   The port value is specified by the server application bound to 
   the URI specified in the c attribute.  The bitrate value specified 
   in the a attribute MUST match the Vorbis sample rate value.

5.1 SDP Based Config Header Transmission

   The optional SDP attributes are used to convey details of the 
   Vorbis stream which are required for codebook caching.  If the 
   following attributes are set they take precedent over values 
   specified in the u attribute detailed above.  The maximum size
   of the mandatory and optional SDP attributes MUST be less than
   1K in size to conform to section 4.1 of [8].

   a=md5key:<MD5 key of codebook>
   a=bitrate_min:<Bitrate Minimum>
   a=bitrate_norm:<Bitrate Normal>
   a=bitrate_max:<Bitrate Maximum>
   a=bsz0:<Block Size 0>
   a=bsz1:<Block Size 1>
   a=channels:<Num Audio Channels>
   a=meta_vendor:<Vendor Name>

   If the codebook MD5 attribute, md5key, is set the key is compared 
   to a locally held cache and if found the associated local codebook 
   is used, if not the client MUST use the configuration headers
   specified in the u attribute.  

   The md5key requires other attributes which detail bitrates, channels
   and metadata associated with the RTP stream.  The attributes
   following the md5key example above MUST all be present.

   The metadata attribute, meta_vendor, provides the bare minimum 
   information required for decoding but does not convey any 
   meaningfull stream metadata information.  As outlined in the Vorbis 
   comment field and header specification documentation, [7], a number 
   of predefined field names are available which SHOULD be used.  An 
   example would be:

7 Congestion Control    

   Vorbis clients SHOULD send regular receiver reports detailing 
   congestion.  A mechanism for dynamically downgrading the stream, 
   known as bitrate peeling, will allow for a graceful backing off
   of the stream bitrate.  This feature is not available at present
   so an alternative would be to redirect the client to a lower 
   bitrate stream if one is available.

8 Security Considerations

   RTP packets using this payload format are subject to the security 
   considerations discussed in the RTP specification [3].  This implies 
   that the confidentiality of the media stream is achieved by using
   encryption.  Because the data compression used with this payload
   format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed on the 
   compressed data.  Where the size of a data block is set care MUST 
   be taken to prevent buffer overflows in the client applications.

Subject: [AVT] Re: Status of draft-kerr-avt-vorbis-rtp-01

Hi Phil,

--> philkerr@elec.gla.ac.uk writes:
I'm checking on the status of draft-kerr-avt-vorbis-rtp-01 and how things can be
moved forward with it.  The update was submitted just before the cutoff for the
last AVT meeting and there seems to have been no action on it since.

I took the liberty of cc'ing the AVT mailing list, to encourage feedback.

There are a few small changes I may wish to make to the draft, which will be
discussed at a Vorbis meeting tomorrow, but I wanted to check with you first on
if the 01 draft is good enough to move forward.

I think it's in good shape, although I have a couple of issues:

 - Section 2.1 notes that the P, X and CC fields of the RTP header are set
   to 0. I'm not sure it's appropriate for a payload format to specify this: 
   I can imagine valid scenarios where each of these can be used with Vorbis. *

 - The discussion in section 3 can make use of normative language to be
   clear on how frames are packetized. I suggest the following changes:

       Any Vorbis packet that is larger than 256 octets and less than the
       path-MTU should be placed in a RTP packet by itself.
                ^^^^^^ MUST
*
       Any Vorbis packet that is 256 bytes or less should be bundled in the
                                                   ^^^^^^ SHOULD
       RTP packet with as many Vorbis packets as will fit, up to a maximum
       of 32.
*
       If a Vorbis packet will not fit into the RTP packet, it must be 
                within the network MTU ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^ SHOULD
       fragmented.  A fragmented packet has a zero in the last five bits 
       of the payload header.  Each fragment after the first will also set 
       the Continued (C) bit to one in the payload header.  The RTP packet 
       containing the last fragment of the Vorbis packet will have the 
       Marker (F) bit set to one.
       ^^^^^^ Final Fragment 
                  (to avoid confusion with the RTP Marker bit)
*

 - The IANA considerations section needs to be expanded. Section 4 of RFC
   3047 is a good example, to illustrate the format. *

 - Regarding the configuration headers, is there a need to send updates
   during a session? If not, it might be appropriate to define some SDP
   parameters to convey the configuration data at session initiation time,
   rather than relying on RTCP. If RTCP is to be used, it's necessary to
   discuss reliability, and how a receiver reacts if the information is
   lost.

I also have a few editorial comments:

 - The interpretation of key words and reference to RFC 2119 should be
   moved into the Introduction rather than being in the Status of this
   Memo section. *

 - I suggest moving the last three paragraphs of the Introduction into
   section 2.3, where the packing of the payload data is discussed. It
   may also be appropriate to include a slightly longer description of
   the Vorbis codec and when it might be useful in the Introduction. *

 - In section 3.1, it might be useful to include the RTP packet header 
   details, to show how the RTP sequence number and timestamp are used
   (sequence number increases by one for each packet, timestamp stays 
   the same for each fragment). *

 - Section 7 might reference the discussion of congestion control in 
   the RTP spec and/or profile

 - References should be split into Normative and Informative sections. *


Cheers,
Colin

Hi All,

Please find below an updated Vorbis-RTP Internet Draft document for review and discussion at the Xiph IRC meeting on Saturday.

The changes in this version have been:

Codebook caching mechanism
Expanded SDP parameters
Expanded MIME section
Expanded introduction
Packet loss section
Minor tweaks and clarity changes to text

There are probably some minor tweaks to the formatting needed which will be done before the final submission.

Open issues concern:

Bitrate peeling for congestion control needs to be firmed up
A clearer definition of the path MTU is probably needed

Feedback and comments welcomed of course.

All being well I will submit this to the IETF early next week with a request to move the document to AVT WG status (a step closer to RFC).

Regards

Phil


Annexe) some comments on  draft-kerr-avt-vorbis-rtp-01 :
    - Section 3, p5.  "path-MTU" is not a clear concept in IP multicast.
      (path-mtu discover algorithm not operationnal here)
      Open issue : optimal value for a "RTP-MTU" with vorbis ?
          (IP fragmentation/reassembling vs RTP framentation/reassembling ?) 
          (size and frequency of "big" vorbis packet ?)
          (optimistic MTU=1500, pessimistic MTU=500, Neutral MTU=1000 ?) *?

    - Section 5, p.9 last paragraph. "the URI value set there" is in SDP *
      information or in VORB RTCP overflow field ? 
 
    - Section 5 sentence "The framing bit is not used for RTP ..." appears *
      2 times.

    - Section 6, c=IN IP4 .. ; no reason to restrict to IPv4 *

    - Section 6, needs clarification for "all three of the config header *
      blocks". starting of the first block ?

    - Section 2.2,  figure, numbering from 0 to 7 is better *

    - Need rules for reassembling process (Section 3.2 ?).
       Normal process
       misordering ?
       process with loss of fragment ? temporisation ?? *

    - More generally what is the consequence of vorbis packet loss,
      and vorbis packet misordeing ?
    -  ...
